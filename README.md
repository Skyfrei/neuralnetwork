### Implementation of neural networks with SGD and backprop in C++


# Implement SGD or GD 
# Implement Momentum in GD
# Implement momentum
# Implement data shuffling

# Module 4

-> Kernels before CNN

    Kernel is simply a grid of weights laid on top of our input
    Kernels use padding, striding or step sizing and depth, pooling

# Module 5

-> Transfer learning and fine tuning

# Module 6
-> Reccurent Neural Networks
-> LSTM
